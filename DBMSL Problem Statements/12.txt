Given the database schema:

- **Employee** (`employee-name`, `street`, `city`)
- **Works** (`employee-name`, `company-name`, `salary`)
- **Company** (`company-name`, `city`)
- **Manages** (`employee-name`, `manager-name`)

Let's go through each of the queries step by step.

---

### 1. **Find the names of all employees who work for First Bank Corporation.**

You need to join the `Employee` and `Works` tables based on the `employee-name`, and filter the results by the company name.

```sql
SELECT employee-name
FROM works
WHERE company-name = 'First Bank Corporation';
```

---

### 2. **Find the names, street addresses, and cities of residence of all employees who work for First Bank Corporation and earn more than $10,000.**

To get the names, street addresses, and cities of employees who work for "First Bank Corporation" and earn more than $10,000, join the `Employee` and `Works` tables and apply the necessary filters.

```sql
SELECT e.employee-name, e.street, e.city
FROM employee e
JOIN works w ON e.employee-name = w.employee-name
WHERE w.company-name = 'First Bank Corporation'
  AND w.salary > 10000;
```

### 3. **Find all employees in the database who live in the same cities and on the same streets as do their managers.**

This requires joining the `Employee` table with the `Manages` table, and then comparing the street and city values of employees and their managers.

```sql
SELECT e.employee-name
FROM employee e
JOIN manages m ON e.employee-name = m.employee-name
JOIN employee manager ON m.manager-name = manager.employee-name
WHERE e.city = manager.city
  AND e.street = manager.street;
```

### 4. **Find all employees in the database who earn more than each employee of Small Bank Corporation.**

This query involves a subquery where we find all employees who earn more than any employee from "Small Bank Corporation."

```sql
SELECT e.employee-name
FROM works e
WHERE e.salary > ALL (
    SELECT w.salary
    FROM works w
    WHERE w.company-name = 'Small Bank Corporation'
);
```

---

### 5. **Find all employees who earn more than the average salary of all employees of their company.**

For this, we will use a subquery to calculate the average salary for each company, then compare each employee's salary with the average salary of their company.

```sql
SELECT e.employee-name
FROM works e
WHERE e.salary > (
    SELECT AVG(w.salary)
    FROM works w
    WHERE w.company-name = e.company-name
);
```

---

### 6. **Find the company that has the smallest payroll.**

To find the company with the smallest payroll, calculate the total salary for each company and select the company with the smallest total.

```sql
SELECT w.company-name
FROM works w
GROUP BY w.company-name
ORDER BY SUM(w.salary) ASC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY;
```

This query groups the employees by `company-name`, sums their salaries, orders the companies by the total salary, and selects the one with the smallest payroll.
