Here are the SQL queries to address each of the requirements for the given schema:

### Schema:
- **Student** (`Student_Id`, `Student_Name`, `Instructor_Id`, `Student_City`)
- **Instructor** (`Instructor_Id`, `Instructor_Name`, `Instructor_City`, `Specialization`)

### 1. **Find the instructor of each student.**
To find the instructor assigned to each student, you can use a `JOIN` between the `Student` and `Instructor` tables based on `Instructor_Id`.

```sql
SELECT s.Student_Id, s.Student_Name, i.Instructor_Name
FROM Student s
JOIN Instructor i ON s.Instructor_Id = i.Instructor_Id;
```

### 2. **Find the student who is not having any instructor.**
To find students who don't have any assigned instructor, we need to check for `NULL` in the `Instructor_Id` field of the `Student` table.

```sql
SELECT Student_Id, Student_Name
FROM Student
WHERE Instructor_Id IS NULL;
```

### 3. **Find the student who is not having any instructor as well as the instructor who is not having any student.**
This requires two parts:
- Finding students without an instructor.
- Finding instructors who are not assigned to any student.

```sql
-- Students without an instructor
SELECT Student_Id, Student_Name
FROM Student
WHERE Instructor_Id IS NULL;

-- Instructors without any students
SELECT i.Instructor_Id, i.Instructor_Name
FROM Instructor i
LEFT JOIN Student s ON i.Instructor_Id = s.Instructor_Id
WHERE s.Student_Id IS NULL;
```

### 4. **Find the students whose instructorâ€™s specialization is computer.**
To find students whose instructor's specialization is "computer," you can join the `Student` and `Instructor` tables and filter by the `Specialization` column in the `Instructor` table.

```sql
SELECT s.Student_Id, s.Student_Name
FROM Student s
JOIN Instructor i ON s.Instructor_Id = i.Instructor_Id
WHERE i.Specialization = 'Computer';
```

### 5. **Create a view containing the total number of students whose instructor belongs to "Pune".**
You can create a view that counts the number of students whose instructor is located in "Pune."

```sql
CREATE VIEW students_in_pune AS
SELECT COUNT(s.Student_Id) AS Total_Students
FROM Student s
JOIN Instructor i ON s.Instructor_Id = i.Instructor_Id
WHERE i.Instructor_City = 'Pune';
```

After creating this view, you can query it to get the total number of students.

```sql
SELECT * FROM students_in_pune;
```

### Summary of Queries:
1. **Instructor of each student**: Join `Student` and `Instructor` tables.
2. **Student without any instructor**: Filter by `NULL` in `Instructor_Id`.
3. **Students without instructor and instructors without students**: Two separate queries using `LEFT JOIN`.
4. **Students whose instructor specializes in computer**: Join `Student` and `Instructor` with specialization filter.
5. **View for total students with instructors from Pune**: Create a view that counts the students where the instructor's city is "Pune".
