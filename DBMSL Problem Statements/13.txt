### Given the Database Schema:

- **Employee** (`employee-name`, `street`, `city`)
- **Works** (`employee-name`, `company-name`, `salary`)
- **Company** (`company-name`, `city`)
- **Manages** (`employee-name`, `manager-name`)

### SQL Queries for Each Requirement:

---

### 1. **Find the names and cities of residence of all employees who work for First Bank Corporation.**

We need to join the `Employee` and `Works` tables based on the `employee-name` and filter by `company-name = 'First Bank Corporation'`.

```sql
SELECT e.employee-name, e.city
FROM employee e
JOIN works w ON e.employee-name = w.employee-name
WHERE w.company-name = 'First Bank Corporation';
```

---

### 2. **Find all employees in the database who live in the same cities as the companies for which they work.**

To find employees who live in the same cities as the companies they work for, we need to join the `Employee`, `Works`, and `Company` tables, and compare the `city` in both the `Employee` and `Company` tables.

```sql
SELECT e.employee-name
FROM employee e
JOIN works w ON e.employee-name = w.employee-name
JOIN company c ON w.company-name = c.company-name
WHERE e.city = c.city;
```

---

### 3. **Find all employees in the database who do not work for First Bank Corporation.**

We need to find all employees who do **not** work for "First Bank Corporation". This can be done using a `NOT EXISTS` or `NOT IN` clause.

```sql
SELECT e.employee-name
FROM employee e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM works w
    WHERE w.employee-name = e.employee-name
    AND w.company-name = 'First Bank Corporation'
);
```

Alternatively, you can use `NOT IN`:

```sql
SELECT e.employee-name
FROM employee e
WHERE e.employee-name NOT IN (
    SELECT w.employee-name
    FROM works w
    WHERE w.company-name = 'First Bank Corporation'
);
```

---

### 4. **Assume that the companies may be located in several cities. Find all companies located in every city in which Small Bank Corporation is located.**

We can achieve this by using a `NOT EXISTS` clause to find companies located in every city where "Small Bank Corporation" has a presence.

```sql
SELECT c.company-name
FROM company c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM company c2
    WHERE c2.company-name = 'Small Bank Corporation'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM company c3
        WHERE c3.company-name = c.company-name
        AND c3.city = c2.city
    )
);
```

This query ensures that the company is located in **every** city where "Small Bank Corporation" is located.

---

### 5. **Find the company that has the most employees.**

To find the company with the most employees, we need to count the number of employees for each company and then select the one with the maximum count.

```sql
SELECT w.company-name
FROM works w
GROUP BY w.company-name
ORDER BY COUNT(w.employee-name) DESC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY;
```

Alternatively, for some SQL engines that don't support `FETCH FIRST`, you can use a subquery:

```sql
SELECT company-name
FROM works
GROUP BY company-name
HAVING COUNT(employee-name) = (
    SELECT MAX(emp_count)
    FROM (
        SELECT company-name, COUNT(employee-name) AS emp_count
        FROM works
        GROUP BY company-name
    )
);
```

---

### 6. **Find those companies whose employees earn a higher salary, on average, than the average salary at First Bank Corporation.**

We need to find companies where the average salary of their employees exceeds the average salary of employees at "First Bank Corporation". This can be done by using a subquery to calculate the average salary for "First Bank Corporation" and comparing it with the average salary for other companies.

```sql
SELECT w.company-name
FROM works w
GROUP BY w.company-name
HAVING AVG(w.salary) > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM works
    WHERE company-name = 'First Bank Corporation'
);
```

---

### Summary of Queries:

1. **Employees of First Bank Corporation**: Join `Employee` and `Works` tables and filter by company name.
2. **Employees living in the same cities as their companies**: Join `Employee`, `Works`, and `Company` tables, and compare cities.
3. **Employees who do not work for First Bank Corporation**: Use `NOT EXISTS` or `NOT IN` to exclude employees working for the specified company.
4. **Companies located in every city where Small Bank Corporation is located**: Use `NOT EXISTS` to check for presence in all cities of Small Bank Corporation.
5. **Company with the most employees**: Group by company and order by count of employees.
6. **Companies with higher average salaries than First Bank Corporation**: Use a subquery to compare average salaries.
