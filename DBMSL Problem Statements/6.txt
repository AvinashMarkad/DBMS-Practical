Here is a PL/SQL block using a cursor to update the salaries of employees with a bonus based on the specified conditions:

```sql
DECLARE
    -- Declare variables to hold employee data
    CURSOR emp_cursor IS 
        SELECT eno, salary FROM Emp;
    
    v_eno Emp.eno%TYPE;
    v_salary Emp.salary%TYPE;
BEGIN
    -- Open cursor and loop through each employee
    OPEN emp_cursor;
    
    LOOP
        FETCH emp_cursor INTO v_eno, v_salary;
        
        -- Exit loop when no more records are found
        EXIT WHEN emp_cursor%NOTFOUND;
        
        -- Apply bonus based on salary conditions
        IF v_salary > 4000 THEN
            UPDATE Emp
            SET salary = salary + 5000
            WHERE eno = v_eno;
        ELSIF v_salary <= 4000 THEN
            UPDATE Emp
            SET salary = salary + 1000
            WHERE eno = v_eno;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
    
    -- Close the cursor
    CLOSE emp_cursor;
    
    -- Commit the changes to the database
    COMMIT;
END;
```

### Explanation:
- **Cursor Declaration**: `emp_cursor` is declared to select `eno` and `salary` from the `Emp` table.
- **Looping Through Records**: The cursor is opened, and a loop fetches each employee's `eno` and `salary`.
- **Condition Check**: 
  - If the salary is greater than 4000, a bonus of 5000 is added.
  - If the salary is less than or equal to 4000, a bonus of 1000 is added.
- **Update and Commit**: The `UPDATE` statement modifies the `salary`, and `COMMIT` ensures changes are saved.

This block will update the employee records with the appropriate bonuses. Let me know if you have any questions or need any adjustments!





Here is the PL/SQL block without the comments:

```sql
DECLARE
    CURSOR emp_cursor IS 
        SELECT eno, salary FROM Emp;
    
    v_eno Emp.eno%TYPE;
    v_salary Emp.salary%TYPE;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cursor;
    
    LOOP
        FETCH emp_cursor INTO v_eno, v_salary;
        
        EXIT WHEN emp_cursor%NOTFOUND;
        
        IF v_salary > 4000 THEN
            UPDATE Emp
            SET salary = salary + 5000
            WHERE eno = v_eno;
        ELSIF v_salary <= 4000 THEN
            UPDATE Emp
            SET salary = salary + 1000
            WHERE eno = v_eno;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
    
    CLOSE emp_cursor;
