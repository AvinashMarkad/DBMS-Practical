### Given the Schema:

- **Employee** (`employee_id`, `employee_name`, `City`, `Company_Name`, `Salary`)

---

### 11. **Find details of all employees who work for company “IBM” and live in city “Pune”.**

To retrieve employees working for "IBM" and residing in "Pune", you need to filter based on both `Company_Name` and `City`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employee
WHERE Company_Name = 'IBM' 
  AND City = 'Pune';
```

---

### 12. **Find names, and cities of all employees who work for “Infosys” or earn more than 30,000.**

Here, you want to retrieve employees who either work for "Infosys" or have a salary greater than 30,000. This can be achieved using the `OR` condition.

```sql
SELECT employee_name, City
FROM Employee
WHERE Company_Name = 'Infosys' 
   OR Salary > 30000;
```

---

### 13. **Find all employees who are employees of “IBM” and not living in city “Mumbai”.**

For this, you need to find employees who work for "IBM" and exclude those living in "Mumbai". Use `AND` to specify both conditions.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employee
WHERE Company_Name = 'IBM'
  AND City != 'Mumbai';
```

Alternatively, you can use `NOT`:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employee
WHERE Company_Name = 'IBM'
  AND NOT City = 'Mumbai';
```

---

### 14. **Find company-wise maximum salary.**

To find the maximum salary for each company, you can group by `Company_Name` and use the `MAX` function.

```sql
SELECT Company_Name, MAX(Salary) AS Max_Salary
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Company_Name;
```

---

### 15. **Find those companies whose employees earn higher salary than the average salary at “IBM”.**

First, you need to find the average salary at "IBM", and then retrieve companies where the average salary of their employees exceeds that value. This requires a subquery.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Company_Name
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Company_Name
HAVING AVG(Salary) > (
    SELECT AVG(Salary)
    FROM Employee
    WHERE Company_Name = 'IBM'
);
```

---

### Summary of SQL Queries:

1. **Employees at "IBM" in "Pune"**: Simple `SELECT` with filters for `Company_Name` and `City`.
2. **Employees working for "Infosys" or earning more than 30,000**: Use `OR` to include both conditions.
3. **Employees of "IBM" not in "Mumbai"**: Use `AND` to filter by company and city.
4. **Company-wise maximum salary**: Use `GROUP BY` with `MAX` to find the highest salary for each company.
5. **Companies with higher salaries than the average salary at "IBM"**: Use a subquery to calculate the average salary at "IBM" and compare it with other companies' average salaries.
